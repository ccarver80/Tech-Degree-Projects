# Project #1 - Random Quote Generator
Using vanilla javascript, I made a simple random quote generator that picks a random quote from a array of objects. I also built a random color generator that will change the background color on every new quote. For extra credit I created a 5 second timer that will randomly pick a quote if the button isn't clicked.

# Project #2 - Data Pagination
Using nothing but JavaScript, I took an array of "random user" objects and using DOM manipulation I displayed them on the page. I then created pagination to display only 9 at a time.
