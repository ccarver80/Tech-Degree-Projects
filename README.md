# Project #1 - Random Quote Generator
Using vanilla javascript, I made a simple random quote generator that picks a random quote from a array of objects. I also built a random color generator that will change the background color on every new quote. For extra credit I created a 5 second timer that will randomly pick a quote if the button isn't clicked.

# Project #2 - Data Pagination and Filtering
Using nothing but JavaScript, I took an array of "random user" objects and using DOM manipulation I displayed them on the page. I then created pagination to display only 9 at a time.

# Project #3 - Interactive Form
Learning about Regex, and how to check input data on a form, I built a interactive form that checks all sorts of data like if email is entered correctly, or if the credit card data is a valid credit card number.

# Project #4 - OOP Game Show App
I Created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." This app uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. Can you guess the phrase before you run out of attempts?

# Project #5 - Public API Requests
Using the public API "https://randomuser.me" this project grabs information from 12 random users and using DOM manipulation I displayed them on the website. Clicking on a profile displays more information on each random user.

# Project #10 - Fullstack React App
Using the backend from project #9, I built the front end using React to allow users to view a list of courses and the detail for a specific course, sign up to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses.
